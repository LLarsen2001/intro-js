// 1. What is the Difference Between =, ==, and === in JavaScript 
//= is to say that to thing are the same as in equal too
//== is a comparison operator, which transforms the operands having the same type before comparison.

// This operator performs type casting for equality

// 2. What are template literals in js?

// 3. What are the differences between variables created using let, var or const?
// The differences between var, let, and const variable declaration in JavaScript include:
// Variables declared with var and const are scoped to the immediate function body.
// Variables declared with the var keyword are hoisted. Hoisting means that the variable can be accessed in their enclosing scope even before they are declared.
// Variables declared with the let keyword are block-scoped, which means the variables will have scope to the immediate enclosing block.



// 4. What are data types in javascript?
//n Javascript, there are five basic, or primitive, types of data. The five most basic types of data are strings, numbers, booleans, undefined, and null. We refer to these as primitive data types. A single variable can only store a single type of data.
